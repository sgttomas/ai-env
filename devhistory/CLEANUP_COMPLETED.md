# Obsolete chirality-ai-backend Cleanup - COMPLETED ✅

**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Status**: Successfully removed and references updated

## 🧹 **Cleanup Actions Completed**

### ✅ **1. Updated Docker Compose References**
**File**: `chirality-ai/compose/docker-compose.yml`

**Before** (pointing to obsolete directory):
```yaml
build: ../../chirality-ai-backend/graphql  # ❌ Obsolete
build: ../../chirality-ai-backend/admin    # ❌ Obsolete
```

**After** (pointing to merged services):
```yaml
build: ../../chirality-semantic-framework/graphql  # ✅ Merged services
build: ../../chirality-semantic-framework/admin    # ✅ Merged services
```

### ✅ **2. Deleted Obsolete Directory**
```bash
rm -rf chirality-ai-backend/  # ✅ Successfully removed
```

**What was deleted**:
- ❌ `admin/` service (duplicated in main framework)
- ❌ `graphql/` service (duplicated in main framework)  
- ❌ Backend-services branch content (already merged)
- ❌ Confusing duplicate configurations

### ✅ **3. Validated Configuration**
- ✅ Docker Compose config is valid
- ✅ Target services exist in main framework
- ✅ All references properly updated

## 📊 **Current Clean Architecture**
