# Knowledge Transfer Manifest

**Canonical list of knowledge transfer files from chirality-ai-app to chirality-semantic-framework**

## Purpose

This manifest defines the authoritative set of documentation files that constitute the knowledge transfer pipeline from the TypeScript application to the Python framework. These files enable bidirectional understanding between the two halves of the Chirality system.

## Canonical File List

The following 26 files comprise the complete knowledge transfer set:

1. **API.md** - REST and GraphQL interface documentation
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design and implementation patterns
3. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and changes
4. **CLAUDE - to be replaced with a new instance for this folder specificalliy as per instructions.md** - AI collaboration guide (needs updating)
5. **COMMIT_HOOKS.md** - Git workflow integration
6. **CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - Ongoing documentation improvement process
7. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Development guidelines
8. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Current development state
9. **GRAPHQL_NEO4J_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md** - Graph integration details
10. **HELP.md** - Troubleshooting and support
11. **INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Detailed integration patterns
12. **KEY_DECISIONS.md** - Architectural decision rationale
13. **KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md** - Documentation status tracking
14. **KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER_MANIFEST.md** - This file (canonical list)
15. **LICENSE** - MIT license
16. **MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Implementation roadmap
17. **NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md** - Semantic layer integration
18. **ONBOARDING.md** - User onboarding guide
19. **PROJECT_DIRECTORY.md** - Project structure navigation
20. **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
21. **RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md** - Release documentation
22. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions
23. **VERSION.md** - Version tracking methodology
24. **package-lock.json** - NPM dependency lock file
25. **package.json** - NPM package configuration
26. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies
27. **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration

## Usage

When synchronizing documentation between projects:
1. Refer to this manifest as the authoritative list
2. Ensure all files listed here are present and current
3. Update this manifest if files are added or removed
4. The CLAUDE.md file should be replaced with project-specific guidance

## Location

- **This directory**: `/Users/ryan/Desktop/ai-env/chirality-semantic-framework/lib/chirality-ai-app/`
- **Mirror directory**: `/Users/ryan/Desktop/ai-env/chirality-ai-app/lib/chirality-semantic-framework/`

## Maintenance

This manifest should be updated whenever:
- New documentation files are added to the knowledge transfer pipeline
- Files are removed from the transfer set
- The structure of the knowledge transfer changes
