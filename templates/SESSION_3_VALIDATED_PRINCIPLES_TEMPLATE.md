# SESSION_3_VALIDATED_PRINCIPLES_TEMPLATE (Deprecated)

Status: Deprecated. To prevent drift, the validated principles now live in the Architecture document as a single source of truth.

Where to put principles
- Add them under “Guiding Principles” in your repository’s `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Use the ready-to-paste section in `lib/templates/ARCHITECTURE_SPLIT_APPS_EXAMPLES.md`.

If you need the detailed methodology
- Embed any of the following as subsections of `ARCHITECTURE.md` rather than maintaining a separate template:
  - Clean Baseline Approach
  - Elegant Minimal Changes (~20-line principle)
  - Systematic Validation (baseline, benchmarks, evidence)
  - AI-Human Collaboration Optimization
  - Validation Gates and Invariants
  - Anti-Patterns to Avoid
  - Success Metrics

Migration checklist
- Move principles into `ARCHITECTURE.md` → “Guiding Principles”.
- Remove references to this template from docs/READMEs.
- Treat `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the canonical home going forward.
