# [Component Name]: Chirality Framework Implementation

## 🧠 Meta-Learning Framework

This component implements the **Chirality Framework** - a meta-ontological methodology for generating reliable knowledge about generating reliable knowledge. The framework operates through systematic **12-station semantic valley progression**, validated through self-referential implementation.

### Core Principles

**Meta-Ontological Foundation**
- Generates reliable knowledge about generating reliable knowledge
- Self-referential validation: successfully uses the methodology to validate itself
- System-agnostic and domain-extensible by design

**12-Station Semantic Valley**
Problem Statement → Requirements → Objectives → Output → Verification → Validation → Evaluation → Assessment → Implementation → Instantiation → Reflection → Resolution

**LLM as Semantic Interpolation Engine**
Large Language Models serve exclusively as **semantic interpolation engines** that resolve abstract word pairings into coherent concepts through semantic operations:
- Semantic Multiplication (`*`): Combining word meanings into coherent concepts
- Semantic Addition (`+`): Concatenation of semantic elements  
- Semantic Cross Product (`×`): Hierarchical meaning expansion

## 🤝 Contributing

This project implements a reasoning compiler that systematically generates reliable knowledge. Contributions should maintain the framework's meta-learning integrity and respect the boundary between constructive (human-designed) and generative (LLM-resolved) operations.
