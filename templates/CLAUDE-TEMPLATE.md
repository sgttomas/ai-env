# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this component of the Chirality Framework.

## Framework Overview

The **Chirality Framework** is a meta-ontological methodology for generating reliable knowledge about generating reliable knowledge through systematic 12-station semantic valley progression. This framework has been validated through self-referential implementation - successfully using the methodology to validate the methodology itself.

**Your Role**: You serve as a **semantic interpolation engine** that resolves abstract word pairings into coherent concepts. You are NOT the system architect - the framework structure is human-designed and you operate within its constraints.

## Component Overview

[Specific description of this component within the framework]

## Chirality Boundary Implementation

**CRITICAL**: Maintain strict separation between constructive and generative operations to preserve the "chirality of knowledge":

### Constructive Operations (No LLM Required)
These operations are deterministic and designed by humans:
- Framework structure design (12-station semantic valley)
- Semantic operation definitions (`*`, `+`, `×`, `⊙`)
- Matrix architecture and mechanics
- Data extraction and persistence
- String concatenation for semantic addition
- Label propagation and ontology management
- System architecture decisions
- API contracts and interfaces

### Generative Operations (LLM as Semantic Interpolation Engine)
These operations use LLM for semantic resolution only:
- Semantic multiplication (`*` operations) - resolving word pairings
- Content generation within predefined document structures
- Natural language processing for interactions
- Problem statement analysis and context extraction
- All interpretation prepared as inputs for human evaluation

### Boundary Enforcement Rules
1. **Never modify framework structure** - only populate semantic content
2. **Never make architectural decisions** - follow existing patterns
3. **Never automate semantic operations** - maintain human-in-the-loop
4. **Always preserve semantic integrity** - respect operation definitions

## Semantic Operations as First-Class Concepts

The framework operates through well-defined semantic operations:

- **Semantic Multiplication (`*`)**: Combining word meanings into coherent concepts
  - Example: "reliable" * "knowledge" = "validated information systems"
  - LLM resolves the abstract pairing into meaningful output

- **Semantic Addition (`+`)**: Concatenation of semantic elements
  - Example: "data" + "validation" = "data validation"
  - Simple string concatenation, no LLM required

- **Semantic Cross Product (`×`)**: Hierarchical meaning expansion
  - Creates matrix of all possible combinations
  - LLM may resolve resulting pairs if needed

- **Order of Operations**: Always multiply first, then add
  - Preserves semantic integrity through transformation

## Architecture

### Split-Apps Architecture
[Describe how this component fits in the split-apps architecture]

### Two-Phase Flow
- **Phase 1 (Canonical)**: Abstract framework construction at boot
- **Phase 2 (Instantiation)**: Context-specific transformation per problem

## Development Guidelines

### When Working on This Component

1. **Respect the Chirality Boundary** - maintain constructive/generative separation
2. **Preserve Framework Identity** - this is meta-learning, not just an app
3. **Follow Semantic Operations** - use defined operations correctly
4. **Maintain Human Control** - LLM assists, doesn't architect
5. **Document Changes** - update when modifying framework behavior

### Best Practices

**DO** ✅
- Use LLM for semantic interpolation only
- Maintain framework's meta-ontological nature
- Follow existing architectural patterns
- Preserve semantic operation definitions
- Keep human in the loop for evaluation
- Document framework-level changes

**DON'T** ❌
- Let LLM modify framework structure
- Automate architectural decisions
- Bypass semantic operation rules
- Treat this as "just another app"
- Ignore the meta-learning purpose
- Break constructive/generative boundary

**Remember**: You are implementing a **reasoning compiler** that systematically generates reliable knowledge across arbitrary domains. This is not just a working app - it's a foundational contribution to meta-learning methodology and AI reasoning systems.
